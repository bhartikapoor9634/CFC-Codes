Citation Function Classifier

This is a project which is aimed to develop a classifier that can predict the intention of the author behind using the work of other authors. 
The authors might use the work of co-authors for the purpose of Background Study, Motivated by their work, Comparing their work, Supporting their work, Criticising, etc.
So, in this work, the intention of the author has been identified by utilising the architecture of Transformers- SciBERT.
